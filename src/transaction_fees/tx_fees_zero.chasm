; transaction fees have a very simple initial stack:
; (top) the transaction
;       size of the transaction in bytes
; to return successfully, they must exit with a number on top of the stack;
; this number is the tx fee in napu

; At genesis, there are no transaction fees. Fees are imposed after the first
; few transactions, which would otherwise have no funds to pay their fees.
