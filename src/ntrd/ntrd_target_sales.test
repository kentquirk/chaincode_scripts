; validation scripts expect an account, a tx, and a bitmask
; but if our script doesn't inspect them (and this one doesn't)
; we can just push a 0 rather than an account record

; first let's try a EVENT_CHANGEVALIDATION that should work
; with 1 of each of first two signature sets
push 0
push { TX_QUANTITY: 100 }
push 0x05
event EVENT_CHANGEVALIDATION
run succeed

clear
; now do the same for 2 bpc sigs
push 0
push { TX_QUANTITY: 100 }
push 0x60
event EVENT_CHANGEVALIDATION
run succeed

clear
; now expect a failure for 1 ntrd and 1 bpc
push 0
push { TX_QUANTITY: 100 }
push 0x22
event EVENT_CHANGEVALIDATION
run fail

clear
; expect a failure for 2 ntrd in the first group
push 0
push { TX_QUANTITY: 100 }
push 0x03
event EVENT_CHANGEVALIDATION
run fail

clear
; expect a failure for 2 ntrd in the same group
push 0
push { TX_QUANTITY: 100 }
push 0x0C
event EVENT_CHANGEVALIDATION
run fail

; all done, get out of here
quit
