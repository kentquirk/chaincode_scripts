; Post-setup recoverable account
;
; After the recovery service is set up, the ndau wallet app's public key is
; added to the account. If the recovery service is needed in the future, it will
; be because the ndau wallet app key is lost. We again don't want to require a
; 2-of-2 requirement for the recovery service, so our validation rules are still
; that only one signature is required for any transaction.
;
; Expected arguments on the stack in order from bottom to top are:
;    account
;    transaction
;    bitmask of which authorized keys were found in the signature list

handler EVENT_DEFAULT {
    zero
